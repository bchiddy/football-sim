# Premier League Simulator

This command line program written in C++ allows you to run a Monte Carlo simulation a Premier League season and display the resulting league table. It provides a fun and interactive way to predict the outcomes of matches and see how your favorite teams perform over the course of a season.

## Features

- **Season Simulation:** The program simulates an entire Premier League season, generating random match outcomes based on predefined team strengths.
- **Realistic Results:** The simulated match outcomes take into account the relative strengths of the competing teams, ensuring that the results reflect the probabilities seen in real season.
- **League Table:** After the simulation is complete, the program calculates and displays the final league table, showing the rankings of all teams based on their performance throughout the season.
- **Team Statistics:** In addition to the league table, the program provides individual team statistics such as total wins, losses, draws, goals scored, and goals conceded.
